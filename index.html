                    <h2>Projects</h2>
                    <h3>Kuro Engine</h3>
                    <span> A project I'm currently working on, slowly but surely. It's a small 3d engine that I'm making for mainlu learning purposes </span>
                    <h3>MZK Overdrive </h3>
                    <span> An Overdrive Pedal. <br>
                        The first time I worked on an electronics project by my own. Also my first audio related project. </span>
                    <h3>Algorithm Viewer</h3>
                    <span> This is an old project I made for school. I was inspired by some videos that showcased sorting algorithms visually and recreated it in C++ using SDL to render the animations. </span>
                    <h3>YOMIH In your terminal</h3>
                    <span>Another school project. Based in Your Only Move Is Hustle, I did my best to recreate the game in a CLI environment. Every "frame" is processed and information is printed about the locations and statuses of the characters. </span>
